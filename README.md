# Project 9 - Music Releases
Assigment was to learn the basic of React and be able to build components writing JSX and JS to make a music release site using api content from Spotify. 

## The problem

Requirements: 
- Your app should have components
- Your page should look as close as possible to the design provided.
- You should display the following for each album:
    - album cover image
    - album name
    - the name of each artist involved with a comma between
- Hover effects:
    - When you hover over an album, it should go darker, and you should show a play button, a favourite button, and       the ellipsis (see the design sketch)
    - When you hover over the play button, it should grow (see the design sketch)
    - Hovering an artist name or an album name should match the design sketch
- When you click on the album, it should link to the album's external url in the data
- When you click on an artist, it should link to the artist's external url in the data
- Your page should be responsive:
    - showing 4 albums per row on desktop
    - 2 per row on tablet
    - 1 per row on mobile.

Stretch goal:
- Create CSS rules or Javascript logic so that if there are only two artists you show a "&" between them, and if       there are more than two artists, you show "," between all artists except the last two which should have "&":
- Lower the opacity of the play button icons and then when you hover over the play button, it should have full         opacity
